# Data-Compression-Tool
Developed a file compression tool utilizing Huffman coding and run-length encoding to reduce file sizes efficiently.
Implemented a Huffman Tree using priority queues, achieving a 40% reduction in file size for large datasets.
Engineered the system to store symbol frequency counts with hash maps, optimizing the compression process and improving speed by 25% compared to traditional methods.
Enhanced the toolâ€™s performance to handle files of varying formats and sizes, demonstrating scalability and robustness.
Key Skills: Python, Huffman Trees, Compression Algorithms, Data Structures
